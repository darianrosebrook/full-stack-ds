# docs/

Project documentation for **Full Stack Design System**.

## What goes here

Durable reference for a reader trying to understand the project — design rationale, architectural doctrine, contracts, ADRs, specs, reference material. Everything in this tree should still teach current reality six months from now.

In-flight thinking, roadmaps, and working notes do NOT go here. They live in `docs/internal/` (gitignored, per-contributor). See [`document_governance.md`](./document_governance.md) — "Location" section — for the authority→directory partition rule and the rationale (stale ephemeral content in a consumer-facing tree becomes a trust hazard).

## Frontmatter is enforced

Every `.md` file in this directory (except this `README.md` and anything under `archive/`) must start with a YAML frontmatter block. The contract is defined in [`document_governance.md`](./document_governance.md), and the rule is enforced advisory-only by `.claude/hooks/doc-frontmatter-check.sh` on `Write`/`Edit`.

Minimum required fields:

```yaml
---
doc_id: <STABLE-ID>
authority: <canonical|policy|architecture|adr|spec|reference>
status: <draft|active|implemented|proven|superseded|archived>
title: <human-readable title>
owner: "@<handle>"
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

The `roadmap | working | ephemeral` authority values are valid in the enum but require the doc to live under `docs/internal/` (gitignored).

Some authority/status combinations require extra fields (`governs`, `verified_at_commit`, `superseded_by`, `caws_specs`). See the governance spec for the full table and examples.

The four `*-audit/` matrices are regenerated output. Fix a wrong statement in one by editing its
generator under `scripts/<name>-audit/`, not the markdown — a hand edit is overwritten on the next run.

New top-level docs should pick the right subfolder by authority — e.g., `specifications/` for `authority: spec` reference material, `adrs/` for `authority: adr`. Create the folder if it does not exist. Do NOT create `roadmaps/` or `working/` under `docs/`; those authorities partition into `docs/internal/`.
