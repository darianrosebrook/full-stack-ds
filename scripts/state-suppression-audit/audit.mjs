/**
 * State-suppression rail (RAIL-STATE-SUPPRESSION-01) — read-only.
 *
 * A third obligation axis, independent of the two existing styling rails.
 *
 * A contract may declare that one state dimension SUPPRESSES another category:
 *
 *   "availability": { "values": ["enabled", "disabled"],
 *                     "suppresses": { "categories": ["interaction"] } }
 *
 * That is a claim about rendered behaviour: while disabled, no interaction-state
 * styling applies. The generated CSS honours it only if every property set under
 * an interaction pseudo is either (a) also set in the suppressing state's block,
 * so the later, equal-specificity rule wins it back, or (b) guarded so the
 * interaction selector cannot match a suppressed element at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS NEEDS ITS OWN RAIL. The pseudo-state audit asks "is `disabled`
 * realized at all?" — for Button the answer is yes, a `:disabled` block exists,
 * so it scores realized. Realization and suppression are independent: the block
 * can exist and still reset only some of what `:hover` set. Button's `:hover`
 * sets `border-color`; its `:disabled` block sets `background-color` and
 * `color`. Both selectors are (0,2,0), `:disabled` is later, so it wins the two
 * it declares — and nothing wins back the border. A disabled Button hovered
 * shifts its border to #888889 while every existing gate stays green.
 *
 * REACHABILITY. Not every leak can manifest. On a native form control a
 * natively-disabled element cannot match `:focus-visible` or `:active` — the
 * browser will not focus or activate it — so those leaks are unreachable there
 * and reporting them with equal weight would bury the ~7 real ones in ~30 of
 * noise. `:hover` DOES match disabled elements. On a non-form-control root the
 * disabled state is necessarily an ARIA/class convention, the element stays
 * focusable, and every interaction pseudo is reachable.
 *
 * Both reachable and unreachable leaks are ledgered — the ratchet is about
 * accounting, not severity — but each entry records which it is, so a burn-down
 * slice can start where the user-visible defects are.
 *
 * Scope, mirroring the sibling audits: classification is against the generated
 * React CSS only (the reference framework; all five web families lower from the
 * same IR). Read-only — this rail changes no contract, no styling, no artifact.

 *      need a focusable/activatable element — a plain <div> root matches
 *      neither, no matter what the disabled state is.
 *   2. Can it still match WHILE suppressed? A natively-disabled form control is
 *      removed from focus and activation, so those pseudos go dead there;
 *      `:hover` keeps matching in every engine we target.
 *
