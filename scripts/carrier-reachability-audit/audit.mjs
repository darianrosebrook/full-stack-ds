/**
 * RAIL-WEB-STYLE-CARRIER-REACHABILITY-01 — forward carrier-reachability rail.
 *
 * Asks one question of every contract in the corpus: **does each authored
 * style selector require only component-owned carriers the Web-DOM IR can
 * actually produce?** A selector that names a carrier nothing ever gets
 * compiles into all five web packages and matches zero elements — invisible to
 * every existing rail, because the dead-slot audit asks whether a token slot
 * has a `var()` consumer and here the consumer exists; it just sits in a rule
 * that never fires.
 *
 * The adjudication is NOT here. This script imports
 * `validateStylesCarrierReachability` from compiled `ds-codegen/dist` and only
 * ledgers what it returns. Re-implementing the carrier vocabulary in a script
 * is how a rail and its generator drift into disagreeing while both stay
 * green — the mistake `scripts/variant-style-audit` made by mirroring
 * `computeTaintedAxes`.
 *
 * Two-directional ratchet against `known-unreachable.json`: a new finding
 * fails, a stale entry fails, changed finding identity fails. The ledger is
 * seeded from what the live corpus derives — no count is frozen into the gate.
 *
 * What a ledger entry MEANS: authored CSS requires a carrier the current
 * realization does not produce. It is NOT a licence to delete the declaring
 * contract surface. Resolution may be selector repair, realization repair, or
 * independently justified contract retirement, adjudicated per case
 * (FIX-DEAD-SLOT-UNRENDERED-PART-AUTHORITY-01).
 *
 * Usage:   node scripts/carrier-reachability-audit/audit.mjs [--reseed]
