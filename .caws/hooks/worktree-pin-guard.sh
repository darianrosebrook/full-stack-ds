# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
#
# Worktree Isolation Pin Guard (Entry 41, CAWS-DEFECT-WORKTREE-ISOLATION-PIN-
# RELEASE-01). A session whose project root lives inside .caws/worktrees/<name>
# is PINNED to that worktree: its commands must run there. Unlike the
# consumer-grown static pin that bricked sessions after they merged their own
# worktree, this pin has all three affordances:
#
#   RELEASE  — when the pinned directory no longer exists (merge/destroy
#              deleted it), the pin releases for the rest of the session with
#              a loud advisory. The bricked-session class (every later Bash
#              call refused, including pwd and `caws worktree create`, because
#              the remediation directory is gone) is impossible.
#   RE-POINT — `caws worktree create|ensure` is admitted even from an outside
#              working directory, so the next lane can be born.
#   EXIT     — `caws worktree merge|destroy` is admitted (quiet-merge.sh
#              reroots those commands to the repo root for CWD safety), which
#              is the sanctioned way the pin ends.
#
# The pin is DERIVED statelessly from CAWS_PROJECT_DIR on every call — no
# state file, no latch, no strike ramp — so it cannot outlive the directory
# it names. A pinned session's git operations must target its own worktree:
# `git -C <dir>` redirects and leading `cd <dir> && ... git ...` chains are
# refused when <dir> resolves to the canonical checkout or another worktree;
# git ops redirected to scratch dirs outside the repository stay permitted.
#
# OPT-IN: this guard installs with the shared pack but is NOT wired into the
# default dispatcher HANDLERS (it is a broad session-level cwd enforcement;
# the pack's default-wired guards are narrow). Enable by adding
# worktree-pin-guard.sh to the HANDLERS array in dispatch/pre_tool_use.sh.
