# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.

# CAWS-GOAL-AC-STOP-GATE-01 — hold a session to its bound spec's acceptance criteria.
#
# Opt-in. With no goal binding for this session the handler is a no-op and the
# stop chain behaves exactly as it did before this feature existed.
#
# When `caws goal set <spec-id>` has written a binding, this handler re-derives
# that spec's acceptance evidence with `caws specs verify-acs --json` and emits a
# {"decision":"block"} control decision while any criterion is unmet, so the
# session keeps working instead of stopping on an unproven claim.
#
# Why this and not the native /goal evaluator: that evaluator READS a rendering
# of a check in the transcript. This handler EXECUTES the check and reads its
# real exit status. The two can agree; only this one can be the authority.
#
# "Met" means verdict == verified. A not_rederived criterion is NOT a pass —
# narrative-only evidence is exactly what this gate exists to refuse.
#
# The gate never writes evidence: `caws specs evidence` remains the single
# writer of acceptance truth. It only ever reads verify-acs and writes its own
# block counter to a sidecar next to the binding.
