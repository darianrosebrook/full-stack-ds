# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
#
# CAWS Scope Guard Hook (v11-shape).
# Validates file edits against scope boundaries from per-feature specs under .caws/specs/.
#
# Lifecycle resolution (v11-shape, with v10 fallback):
#   lifecycle_state first, status second.
#   Terminal (not enforced): closed, archived, completed.
#   active: participates in union enforcement.
#   draft: does NOT participate in union-wide blocking unless authoritative/bound.
#   Both fields missing: treat as active (legacy compatibility).
#
# Worktree registry shape compatibility:
#   v11 direct-key: { "<name>": { ... } }
#   v10 nested:     { "worktrees": { "<name>": { ... } } }
#   Bound id key:   specId (v10) OR spec_id (v11) — both accepted.
