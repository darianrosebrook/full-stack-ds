# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it. The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws init finds
#   hooks it can offer updates for. One edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a
#   block instead of fixing the cause.
#
# CAWS Working-Tree Overlap Guard (shared, WORKING-TREE-PROVENANCE-GUARD-001).
#
# Refuses cleanup commands (git stash / git stash push, git restore <path>,
# git checkout -- <path>, git clean -f/-fd/-fdx) when ANOTHER active session's
# claimed_paths / last_modified_paths overlap the working tree. The operator
# must explicitly ack each session+path before the cleanup proceeds, via
# `caws working-tree ack --session <id> --paths <p> [--target <cmd>]`.
#
# This is the shared-checkout multi-session complement to the worktree-active
# block that worktree-guard.sh already enforces. It does NOT remove that block;
# it ADDS the stronger overlap-aware case. Advisory/refusal only — never
# authority; it does not change scope, claim, ownership, or lifecycle state.
#
# Fallback (not silent): if the overlap predicate/CLI cannot run (e.g. an older
# caws without `working-tree check`, or no metadata), the hook admits and emits
# a stderr diagnostic noting the stronger predicate is dormant; worktree-active
# protection still applies via worktree-guard.sh.
