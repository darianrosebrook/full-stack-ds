# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# SessionEnd dispatcher — shared core (surface-neutral).
#
# Fires when the session itself terminates, which is NOT what Stop means:
# Stop fires at the end of every turn, SessionEnd fires once, when the user
# clears, logs out, or exits. Handlers here SEAL what earlier events already
# wrote — they must not render, re-read the transcript, or produce new
# artifacts, because the harness is tearing down around them.
#
# SessionEnd semantics: nothing here may block. The session is already ending
# and the user has no way to respond to a refusal, so all non-zero exits are
# warnings; max_exit is reported but no handler short-circuits the chain.

# CAWS-REPO-HOOK-POLICY-PROJECT-WIRED-01: a repo may commit a compiled chain
# sidecar (dispatch/session_end.chain, written by `caws hooks compile` from
# .caws/hooks/hook-policy.json) that REPLACES the array above. This is the
# project-wired counterpart of the machine launcher's policy tier — without it
# a repo's committed policy would govern only the two machine-routed surfaces
# and silently not the five wired to this dispatcher.
#
# The array above is left INTACT rather than regenerated: rewriting it would
# put this managed pack file permanently in `managed_drift`, so `caws init`
# would refuse every future upstream dispatcher fix.
#
# Absent sidecar -> stock array, one stat. Absent lib -> stock array, via the
# `declare -F` guard, so a partially upgraded pack still dispatches. A
# MALFORMED sidecar is the one case that does not degrade: caws_local_chain
# blocks and exits 2 rather than running a partial guard chain.
