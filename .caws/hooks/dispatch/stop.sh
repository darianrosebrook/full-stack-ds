# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Stop dispatcher — shared core (surface-neutral).
#
# Fires at end of session. Same fan-out semantics as the other dispatchers.
# Handlers here finalize session artifacts: audit log closeout, worktree
# cleanup reminder, plan-transcript finalize, session-log handoff.
#
# Stop semantics: EXIT CODES here are advisory. All non-zero exits are treated
# as warnings; max_exit is reported but no handler short-circuits the chain,
# because the finalizers must all get to run even when one of them fails.
#
# That is a statement about exit codes, NOT about stdout. A handler may still
# emit a hard control decision ({"decision":"block"}) on stdout, which
# run_handlers forwards with priority over any advisory context. Today exactly
# one handler does: goal-ac-gate.sh (CAWS-GOAL-AC-STOP-GATE-01), which refuses
# the stop while the session's bound spec has unproven acceptance criteria.
# A blocking handler here does not end the session — it tells the agent to keep
# working — so the finalizers still running afterwards is correct, not a leak.
