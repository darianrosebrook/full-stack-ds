# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Shared progressive strike handling for CAWS pre-write guard hooks.
#
# STRIKE-STATE KEYING (CAWS-DESIGN-GLOBAL-IDENTITY-HOME-001 A6):
# The counter is SESSION-GLOBAL, keyed by the RESOLVED session id in the
# global home:
#   ~/.caws/state/sessions/<sanitized-session>/strikes.json
# A session wedged in one repo stays wedged in every repo — the sidechain
# route-around (blocked in repo A, go edit repo B instead) does not exist.
# This REVERSES the per-checkout isolation of the pre-global-home model:
# cross-REPO wedge bleed is now the protected property (a wedge is a
# session property, not a repo property). Legacy repo-local strike files
# (vendor logs + worktree gitdirs) are read ONCE for continuity into the
# global record and never written again. An unresolved/unknown session is
# refused with a loud stderr note — no anonymous buckets.
#
# If you are reading this because a guard blocked you: editing this file (or the
# generated guard-strikes JSON) to BYPASS enforcement is the one edit the growth
# stance does not cover — it weakens the guard rather than growing it. The
# correct recovery paths are:
#   1. Switch into the right CAWS worktree.
#   2. Bring the target file into the active spec's scope.in (if it legitimately
#      belongs there), then ask the user to reset your strikes by running:
#        bash ${CAWS_HOOKS_DIR:-.caws/hooks}/reset-strikes.sh --current
#      or the equivalent narrower reset (see --help).
#   3. Ask the user to resolve the conflict explicitly.
# Never edit guard-strikes-*.json files by hand — use reset-strikes.sh so the
# reason is logged.
