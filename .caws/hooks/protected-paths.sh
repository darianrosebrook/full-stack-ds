# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
#
# CAWS Protected Paths Guard
#
# Blocks direct Write/Edit access to:
#   - hook SCRIPTS under the shared pack's install directory (.caws/hooks/)
#     and any vendor-surface hooks dir (no agent-side hook editing):
#     *.sh, *.py, *.cjs — the executable guard artifacts
#   - strike-state files in vendor logs (no manual manipulation of
#     progressive-strike counters)
#
# The shared pack installs its executable guards to .caws/hooks/ for every
# agent surface; CAWS_VENDOR_DIR selects a separate, per-surface
# settings/config directory (e.g. .claude for claude-code) that is not
# generally where the guard scripts themselves live. Protecting only the
# vendor-dir path leaves the pack's actual install directory — where every
# live guard resides — unprotected, so this guard covers both.
#
# Documentation under the hooks dir (*.md — e.g. the installer-managed
# CLAUDE.md, or a hand-authored README.md) is NOT a guard artifact and is
# explicitly ADMITTED. The doctrine this hook enforces protects the
# executable guards from being removed or weakened, not the docs that
# describe them (CAWS-PROTECTED-PATHS-DOCS-NOT-SCRIPTS-001). Blocking a
# legitimate doc edit was the over-match defect: it refused the very
# CLAUDE.md `caws init` itself ships and re-writes, pushing the agent
# toward a bypass — the exact failure mode CAWS exists to prevent. This
# admission applies uniformly across every protected hooks directory,
# including .caws/hooks/ — .pristine/ baselines under .caws/hooks/ are
# written by the CAWS CLI process directly (never by an agent Write/Edit
# tool call), so no separate carve-out is needed for them.
#
# The match keys on the artifact CLASS, not the directory: docs are
# allowlisted, every other extension under the hooks dir stays blocked
# (fail-closed — an unrecognized extension defaults to protected).
#
# SECURITY NOTE: case patterns in bash cannot expand variables, so the
# vendor-dir pattern is written as a conditional using [[ == ]] with
# CAWS_VENDOR_DIR. The .caws/hooks/ pattern is a plain literal — that path
# is the pack's fixed install location, not surface-derived.

# delegates admission to caws_is_write_allowlisted, which returns 0
# (unconditionally allowed) for `.caws/*`, and block-dangerous.sh protects one
# filename under the vendor hooks dir, not the pack's own install directory.
