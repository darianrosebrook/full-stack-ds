# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
#
# Worktree lifecycle CWD hook (legacy filename: quiet-merge.sh)
#
# When an agent's CWD is inside the worktree being destroyed, the process
#    loses its CWD and crashes (posix_spawn ENOENT on PostToolUse hooks).
#
# The fix rewrites merge/destroy commands to `cd <repo-root> && <command>`.
# It intentionally does not pipe, redirect, summarize, or append a confirmation
# command: the governed command's stdout, stderr, and exit status are authority
# signals and must survive byte-for-byte shell execution semantics.
#
# IMPORTANT: This hook MUST be the last PreToolUse hook for Bash commands
# that intercepts input. It emits updatedInput which replaces any prior
# hook's updatedInput. Order in dispatch/pre_tool_use.sh: after the blocking
# guards and advisory scanners, so a real refusal is decided before this
# allow-with-rewrite response is considered.
#
# Promoted from Sterling per CAWS-HOOK-PACK-PROMOTE-001 and
# docs/reports/sterling_hook_port_audit_001.md. Companion to cwd-guard.sh
# (entry 22) for the worktree-destroyed-while-inside class.
