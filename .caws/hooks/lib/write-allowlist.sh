# CAWS Write Allowlist (shared lib).
# CAWS-GUARD-ALLOWLIST-SYNC-001.
#
# ONE source of truth for the unconditional-allow path set. Both
# worktree-write-guard.sh (Write/Edit arm) and bash-write-guard.sh (Bash
# mutation arm) call caws_is_write_allowlisted so the two guards return the
# SAME allow verdict for the SAME path — they cannot diverge by tool.
#
# Doctrine: docs/failure-lineage.md:888 lists the must-permit governance
# allowlist paths (.caws/specs/*, .caws/worktrees.json, .caws/policy.yaml,
# instruction files, docs/). The allowlist encodes that posture so a
# canonical-checkout coordination edit is not blocked regardless of which
# tool the agent reaches for.
#
# CRITICAL: this helper handles ONLY unconditional-allow paths. The
# .caws/worktrees/<name>/<rest> payload path is OWNERSHIP-CHECKED (routed
# through worktree-claim-oracle.cjs) and is deliberately EXCLUDED from this
# allowlist. If a path is on this allowlist, it is allowed with no further
# adjudication; if it is not, the caller still runs its oracle/claim logic.
#
# NOTE on bash case patterns and shell variables:
#   bash case patterns CANNOT expand shell variables, so the agent-state
#   home dir ("${HOME:-}/${CAWS_VENDOR_DIR}/") and the vendor hooks dir
#   ("$PROJECT_DIR/${CAWS_VENDOR_DIR}/") and CAWS_INSTRUCTION_FILES arms
#   are matched via [[ == ]] conditionals, not case patterns. Any future
#   allowlist arm that needs a variable must follow the same pattern.
#
# Requires (sourced by caller BEFORE calling the function):
#   - CAWS_VENDOR_DIR        (from lib/agent-surface.sh)
#   - CAWS_INSTRUCTION_FILES (from lib/agent-surface.sh; optional — empty ok)
#   - HOME                   (env; falls back to empty)
# Caller passes PROJECT_DIR as $2 (falls back to CAWS_PROJECT_DIR or '.').

# lib/guard-config.sh is pulled in HERE rather than by each caller, so that
# every guard reaching the allowlist gets the repo's configured prefixes
# without having to know they exist. A caller that forgot to source it would
# otherwise get shipped-only behavior while its sibling got the configured
# table — the exact desynchronization this lib exists to prevent.
#
# `[[ -f ]] &&` is required, not stylistic: under the callers' `set -euo
# pipefail`, `source <missing>` is a fatal builtin error that a trailing
# `|| true` does NOT catch (CAWS-HOOK-SOURCE-GUARD-FAIL-SOFT-001). The test is
# exempt from `set -e` as a non-final member of an && list.
