# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Typed, bounded Bash mutation recognition. Never evaluates captured commands.
# Recognized operands confer no authority. Empty output means unrecognized,
# not read-only: interpreters, aliases, functions and arbitrary programs remain
# outside this parser. FILE, DYNAMIC, BROAD, UNREPR and UNSUPPORTED are separate
# channels; callers must consume all five. Resolution requires explicit cwd.
# lib/heredoc.sh supplies the shared file-sink policy. Bash 3.2 compatible.

CAWS_TOK_VALUE=()   # byte-faithful token text, quotes and sentinels removed
CAWS_TOK_KIND=()    # word | op | redirect
CAWS_TOK_CTX=()     # the context the token STARTED in: root|dquote|squote|cmdsub|backtick
CAWS_TOK_DYNAMIC=() # 1 if the token carries RUNTIME-RESOLUTION syntax, else 0
# WHICH runtime resolution the token carries. Empty when TOK_DYNAMIC is 0.
# Glob is ONE SUBTYPE, not the definition: a target whose identity is resolved at
# execution cannot be handed to the ownership oracle as if it were the target.
#   pathname | parameter | command_sub | tilde | brace
CAWS_TOK_RESKIND=()
# The statically-known leading path segment, when the lexer can PROVE one from
# preserved lexical structure (core/*.py -> core/). Empty when none is provable.
# The guard must consume this rather than reparsing the expression -- two
# interpreters on opposite sides of the boundary is the defect this lane removes.
CAWS_TOK_PREFIX=()
CAWS_TOK_PREFIX_BASIS=() # lexically_proven | none
# 1 when the operand cannot be transported faithfully by a newline-delimited
# record stream (it contains a newline or tab). Detected at LEXICAL PRODUCTION
# time, before any serialization -- once a record has been split the
# authority-bearing information is already gone.
CAWS_TOK_UNREPR=()

# A command substitution has TWO simultaneous semantic roles and the recognizer
# must preserve BOTH: the outer word is runtime-resolved (its value is decided at
# execution), AND the nested text is executable shell code that may perform its
# own writes. Choosing one role was the defect -- `rm "$(cat f)"` emitted FILE
# [cat] and [f], fabricating two operands while never naming the real deletion
# target.
#
# So a nested span is queued here and lexed as its OWN command, separated from
# the outer token stream by a `;` op. The separator is load-bearing: without it
# an outer verb's operand walk runs straight into the nested command's words and
# consumes them as its own operands, which is exactly how the fabrication arose.

# RECORD KIND IS STRUCTURAL, NEVER INFERRED FROM BYTES. The previous scanner
# discriminated FILE from BROAD by asking whether a line contained a TAB. That
# was sound ONLY because the old tokenizer word-split on IFS, which made a tab
# byte unreachable inside a file operand. This lexer emits byte-faithful
# operands, so that proof is gone and the inference goes with it: records are
# accumulated into three separate arrays by explicit kind, and the public
# channels read those arrays directly rather than grepping a textual encoding.
#
# REPRESENTATION ENVELOPE, AND ITS FAILURE DIRECTION IS NOT SAFE. All public
# channels are newline-delimited record streams read with `while read -r`.
# Newline and tab are legal filename bytes, so byte-faithfulness is claimed
# WITHIN a record only.
#
# The former claim here -- that splitting such an operand is "over-recognition,
# never a bypass" -- was FALSIFIED by measurement: against a live file-specific
# scope.in claim, the plain path BLOCKS (ec=2) while the same path carrying an
# embedded newline ALLOWS (ec=0), because splitting destroys the exact match a
# canonical claim requires and NEITHER fragment matches. That is an ownership
# bypass. Such operands are therefore detected at LEXICAL PRODUCTION TIME and
# routed to CAWS_REC_UNREPR instead of entering the ordinary record stream.
CAWS_REC_FILE=()     # exact-path operands
CAWS_REC_BROAD=()    # directory-scoped mutation kinds (root supplied by caller)
CAWS_REC_DYNAMIC=()  # file-scoped operands whose population resolves at execution
