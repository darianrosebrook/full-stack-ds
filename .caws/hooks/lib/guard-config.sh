#
# Tier-2 guard configuration: the ACCESSOR half.
#
# `lib/guard-config.py` parses `.caws/hooks/hook-policy.json` and
# `.caws/policy.yaml` exactly once per dispatch and prints `NAME=VALUE` lines.
# This file exports them and hands adopting guards plain-bash readers that
# spawn NOTHING. Four guards each shelling out would add ~124ms to every tool
# call against a measured ~31ms per python3 start; one shared parse does not.
#
# bash 3.2 (what macOS ships) has NO associative arrays, so the table is
# carried as individually-named variables read back through `${!name}`
# indirection. That is not a style choice — it is the only portable table.
#
# FAIL-SOFT IS BANNED HERE, FAIL-SHIPPED IS NOT. A guard that cannot load its
# config must keep enforcing its SHIPPED table; it must never conclude
# "no config, therefore allow". Because every key is append-only, falling back
# to the shipped table is strictly the stricter behavior, so the degraded path
# and the safe path are the same path.

# Idempotent source: safe to source multiple times.

# The parser is this file's SIBLING, so resolve it from this file's own

# when a guard runs inside the chain; a guard invoked directly — by bats, by a
# harness that calls one hook, by a human debugging — would otherwise resolve
# "${HOOKS_DIR:-}/lib/guard-config.py" to "/lib/guard-config.py", find nothing,
# and report `unavailable` while the document sat right there. That failure is
# invisible in the chain and total outside it, which is the worst combination:
# it looks fine wherever anyone would notice.

#
# Uppercasing is done by index lookup rather than `tr` because this runs on
