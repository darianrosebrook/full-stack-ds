# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook lib, not a locked one —
#   shape it to your repo. The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how
#   caws init finds libs it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign.
#
# CAWS compiled local chain (shared lib).
# CAWS-REPO-HOOK-POLICY-PROJECT-WIRED-01.
#
# Project-wired surfaces (qwen-code, kimi-code, opencode, zcode, dsh) exec
# .caws/hooks/dispatch/<event>.sh directly, and that dispatcher carries a
# literal HANDLERS=(...) bash array baked in at init time. Machine-routed
# surfaces resolve their chain through the launcher and can read a repo policy;
# these surfaces could not, so a repo's committed hook-policy.json would have
# silently governed two harnesses and not the other five.
#
# This lib closes that gap by reading a COMPILED SIDECAR — written by
# `caws hooks compile`, committed, and regenerated from hook-policy.json:
#
#   dispatch/<event>.chain
#     # caws hook chain v1 surface=<s> event=<e> policy-sha256=<hex> pack=<n>
#     scope-guard.sh<TAB>.caws/hooks/ext/scope-guard.local.sh
#     rg-replace-guard.sh
#
# WHY A SIDECAR AND NOT A REGENERATED ARRAY: rewriting the HANDLERS array in
# the dispatcher would leave that managed pack file permanently in
# `managed_drift`, so `caws init` would refuse every future upstream dispatcher
# fix — and it would feed the same doctor inversion (local growth explaining
# away real lag) this whole design exists to remove.
#
# WHY IT IS NEVER SOURCED: the sidecar is generated data, and sourcing it would
# make the guard plane arbitrarily programmable from a committed artifact — a
# file that the compile step, not a human, last wrote. It is parsed with shell
# builtins only: no eval, no source, no subprocess.
#
# FAIL POSTURE, and it is deliberately asymmetric:
#   - ABSENT sidecar  -> return 1, caller keeps the stock array. One stat. A
#                        repo that never opts in pays nothing and changes
#                        nothing.
#   - MALFORMED line  -> block + exit 2. A sidecar that cannot be trusted must
#                        not degrade to a partial chain: dropping the line you
#                        could not parse is how a guard silently stops running.
#
# bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash) has no associative arrays, so overrides are
# published as individually-named variables read back through ${!name}
# indirection — see caws_local_chain_override.

# caws_local_chain <event>
#   On success sets CAWS_LOCAL_CHAIN (array, in execution order) and one
#   CAWS_LOCAL_OVERRIDE_<mangled> variable per override, then returns 0.
#   Returns 1 when no sidecar exists (caller keeps its stock array).
#   Exits 2 on a malformed sidecar.
