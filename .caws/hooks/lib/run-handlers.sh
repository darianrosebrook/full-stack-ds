# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Shared handler-dispatch loop for CAWS hook dispatchers.
#
# Source this file from a dispatcher script, then call:
#
#   run_handlers [--short-circuit-on-block] <handler-entry>...
#
# Each handler-entry is a whitespace-separated string whose first token is
# the handler script filename (relative to HOOKS_DIR) and whose remaining
# tokens are positional arguments forwarded to that script. Example:
#
#   run_handlers "cwd-guard.sh" "audit.sh tool-use" "session-log.sh"
#
# The caller must set HOOKS_DIR before sourcing this file (the dispatcher
# boilerplate does this already).
#
# Environment variables consumed:
#   HOOK_INPUT_JSON       — the sanitized JSON payload piped to every handler.
#                           If not yet set, parse_hook_input is called to
#                           populate it along with all HOOK_* scalar vars.
#   CAWS_HOOK_DRY_RUN     — if non-empty and non-zero, still invoke every
#                           handler but always return 0 from run_handlers and
#                           emit "[DRY-RUN] <handler>.sh would have exited <N>"
#                           to stderr for any non-zero exit.
#                           (Legacy alias: CLAUDE_HOOK_DRY_RUN is also accepted
#                           for back-compat with existing consumer configs.)
#   CAWS_HOOK_TIMING      — if non-empty and non-zero, emit
#                           "[timing] <handler>.sh: <N>ms" to stderr after
#                           each handler invocation. Does not affect exit codes
#                           or stdout behavior.
#                           (Legacy alias: CLAUDE_HOOK_TIMING is also accepted.)
#   CAWS_HOOK_ADVISORY_BUDGET_BYTES
#                         — maximum bytes for composed additionalContext
#                           members (default 32768). Cards are admitted one at a
#                           time against the bytes still available; a card that
#                           does not fit is truncated to fit with an explicit
#                           elided-byte marker, never dropped to starve later
#                           handlers (CAWS-HOOK-ADVISORY-BUDGET-TIERS-01).
#   CAWS_HOOK_SETTLEMENT_FILE
#                         — machine-adapter-owned manifest receiving selected or
#                           released message-offer membership. Presence enables
#                           per-handler offer sidecars; it never grants a guard
#                           new control authority.
#
# Stdout: hard control decisions retain precedence and are never truncated.
#         Valid additionalContext members compose in handler order under the byte
#         budget, truncated-with-marker when a card does not fit; other non-empty
#         envelopes retain the existing priority selection.
#
# Return value: the maximum exit code across all handlers (or 2 immediately if
#               --short-circuit-on-block is set and any handler exits 2). When
#               CAWS_HOOK_DRY_RUN is set the effective return is always 0.
#
