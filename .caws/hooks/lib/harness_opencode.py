# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
"""opencode harness surface: tool/input maps, noise prefixes, and contract.

opencode keeps no flat-file transcript — history lives in
~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db (message + part tables). lib/opencode-
transcript.py reconstructs a Claude-Code-shaped .jsonl from that DB, and
the claude adapter (harness_claude.py) consumes those rows. So opencode has
NO row-matcher adapter of its own in the renderer's adapter chain today.

This module still owns the opencode surface's contribution to the pipeline:

  - TOOL_NAME_MAP and INPUT_MAPPERS: the "how to translate opencode tool
    calls into Claude-Code tool vocabulary" knowledge. lib/opencode-
    transcript.py imports these instead of defining them locally, so the
    opencode surface owns its own translation contract in one place.

  - NOISE_PREFIXES: user-role rows opencode injects that are not human turns
    (tool-execution echoes, context-authority banners, system-reminder
    blocks). Left unfiltered these open phantom turns.

If opencode ever gains a native row shape that reaches the renderer directly
(without going through the reconstruct script), an adapter is added to the
MODULE.adapters tuple here, and the reconstruct script's output is adjusted
or retired accordingly. Until then, adapters is intentionally empty.
