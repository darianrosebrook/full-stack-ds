# edit_stance: YOURS TO EDIT. This is a starting hook, not a locked one — shape it
#   to your repo: tune thresholds, add checks, remove what does not fit. Your edits
#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.
# Session-scoped guard reprieve consult (CAWS-GUARD-REPRIEVE-SESSION-SCOPED-001).
#
# A reprieve is a governed, per-session, expiring, machine-checkable way to SKIP a
# PreToolUse guard for exactly one agent session. It replaces the anti-pattern of
# commenting a guard out of the dispatcher's HANDLERS array (which disables it for
# EVERY agent, forever, with no reason/approver/expiry).
#
# Machine records live at ${CAWS_HOME:-$HOME/.caws}/state/sessions/<id>/
# guard-reprieve-<id>.json. Global presence shadows legacy project records,
# including malformed, expired and revoked records. Reads never create state.
# A missing global record may be read from the canonical project's vendor
# hooks/state directory for one-time migration compatibility. Grant writes only
# the machine store; revoke writes a global tombstone so fallback cannot revive
# an older grant. Neither state location confers project ownership.
# IDEMPOTENT: safe to source multiple times.
