"""Byte-exact truncation of advisory text for the CAWS hook composer.

CAWS-HOOK-ADVISORY-BUDGET-TIERS-01. The hook composer must fit an advisory card
into a byte budget without splitting a UTF-8 character. Bash cannot do this
correctly: substring expansion indexes by CHARACTER in a UTF-8 locale (so a byte
length cannot be expressed), and building the output from `printf %b` octal
escapes re-interprets those escapes. Four shell-only attempts each produced a
split character, an unbounded emit, or whole-string returns, so the cut lives
here, next to the pack's other Python helper (classify_command.py).

Usage: advisory_truncate.py <max-bytes>
Reads the text on stdin, writes the longest prefix of at most <max-bytes> bytes
that ends on a character boundary, and exits 0. Exit 3 signals a usage error so
the caller can fall back to its own bounded cut.
