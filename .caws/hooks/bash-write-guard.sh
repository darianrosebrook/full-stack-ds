#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force

#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the

# CAWS Bash Write-Target Guard (shared, WORKTREE-ISOLATION-HARDENING-001 Fix 3).
# Self-filters on Bash, extracts write targets for a narrow set of mutation
# forms, routes each through lib/worktree-claim-oracle.cjs — same oracle as
# worktree-write-guard.sh so a Bash mutation and a Write/Edit get the same
# owner-vs-session answer.
#
# Recognized mutation forms:
#   redirection      > FILE   >> FILE
#   tee              tee FILE   tee -a FILE
#   in-place editors sed -i ... FILE   perl -pi ... FILE
#   truncate/touch   truncate ... FILE   touch FILE
#   remove/move/copy rm FILE   mv SRC DST   cp SRC DST   dd of=FILE
#   git path-restore git restore FILE   git checkout -- FILE
#                    git reset -- FILE   git clean
#   interpreter      python / node: write targets appearing as path literals in
#                    inline -c/-e code, heredoc bodies, or the content of a
#                    script file named on the command line (write-verb +
#                    path-literal co-occurrence —
#                    CAWS-BASH-GUARD-INTERPRETER-WRITE-01). These reach the
#                    cross-repository check only; they never enter the
#                    worktree-claim oracle, because a literal is evidence of a
#                    target, not proof of one.

# --- interpreter write-target scan (NARROW) ----------------------------------
# CAWS-BASH-GUARD-INTERPRETER-WRITE-01: a mutation performed INSIDE an
# interpreter names no write target on the shell command line, so the
# recognizer above extracts nothing and the guard adjudicates an empty
# candidate set. Writing the scratch script is permitted by design (see the
# /tmp rationale on foreign_repo_root); running it was never adjudicated at
# all. That pair is a complete cross-repo write channel, and it is the one
# session 1aa3f0bd used: `cat > /tmp/apply-fix.mjs` carrying a sibling-repo
# path, then `node /tmp/apply-fix.mjs`, both exit 0.
#
# This scan closes the detectable half: write targets that appear as PATH
# LITERALS inside the interpreter's payload — inline -c/-e code, quoted
# arguments, heredoc bodies, or the content of a script file named on the
# command line. It is a CO-OCCURRENCE predicate: a payload is a write payload
# only when it holds BOTH a write verb of that interpreter's language AND a
# slash-bearing path fragment. Co-occurrence is what keeps reads legal
# (open("<sibling>/x").read() has no write verb), and "inside a DIFFERENT git
# repository" is what keeps /tmp scratch legal.
#
# Interpreter candidates are adjudicated at the CROSS-REPOSITORY boundary ONLY
# and never enter the worktree-claim oracle. A literal in a script body is
# evidence that the script may write there, not proof that it will; feeding
# that to the ownership oracle would turn any in-project path merely MENTIONED
# in a script into a claim conflict. The spec's invariant is that existing
# behavior is unchanged everywhere else, so the high-confidence predicate is
# the only one that acts on this weaker evidence.
#
# What it cannot see: a target COMPUTED at runtime — concatenated from shell
# variables, read out of a config file, or piped in via `python3 -`. That is a
# real residual, named honestly in scope-guard's refusal rather than papered
# over, and it is never an admitted route.
#
# The open() arm requires a literal first argument AND a literal mode string
# containing w/a/x/+, so a read-only open does not register as a write verb.

# --- DYNAMIC operands -------------------------------------------------------
# A dynamic operand (rm core/*.py) names a file-scoped mutation whose target
# POPULATION is only known at execution time. The recognizer deliberately does
# not expand it, so the guard cannot ask the ownership oracle about the actual
# files. It must still take a position, and the conservative one is derived
# rather than invented:
#
#   1. If the pattern's STATIC PREFIX lies inside a foreign worktree, the
#      existing ownership mechanism yields a positive verdict on evidence the
#      guard already trusts -> BLOCK.
#   2. ABSENCE OF A WORKTREE CLAIM IS NOT A CONFINEMENT PROOF. The former rule
#      "no active worktrees -> ALLOW" is withdrawn as unsound under the
#      broadened DYNAMIC type. This guard adjudicates block_foreign_repo BEFORE
#      the claim oracle and independently of worktree state, so an unresolved
#      `$TARGET` or `$(choose_path)` could resolve into a SIBLING REPOSITORY
#      while zero worktrees are active. An empty registry proves only that no
#      WORKTREE claim exists. Allow requires proof that every possible
#      resolution is confined; only a prefix the producer proved lexically can
#      supply it.
#   3. Otherwise -> ASK. Crucially, a `pass` on the static prefix is NOT a pass
#      here. `pass:unclaimed` on `core` means only that `core` itself carries no
#      claim; measured 2026-09-11, the oracle's canonical branch tests
#      globToRegExp(claim).test(candidate), so a file-specific claim on
#      core/a.py cannot match the candidate `core` and would be silently
#      dropped. Letting prefix-pass become a final pass is exactly the leak this
#      policy exists to prevent.
#
# This is a disposition over UNCERTAINTY, not a pattern-overlap oracle; building
# one is out of scope for this slice.
# The static prefix is NO LONGER computed here. The producer derives it from
# preserved lexical structure and ships it in the DYNAMIC record with an explicit
# basis. Recomputing it guard-side would restore two independent interpreters on
# opposite sides of the shared boundary -- the exact defect this lane removes --
# and the guard's copy could not see quoting the lexer already resolved.
