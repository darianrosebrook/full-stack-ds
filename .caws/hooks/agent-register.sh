#   are preserved: caws init treats a changed hook as intended growth and will not
#   clobber it — it shows a diff and asks (--adopt keeps yours; --overwrite --force
#   takes the upstream template). The CAWS-MANAGED-HOOK marker above is only how caws
#   init finds hooks it can offer updates for; it is NOT a keep-out sign. CAWS owns the
#   failure-class invariant (the why/what a guard protects); you own the how. The one
#   edit to avoid: gutting a guard to dodge a block instead of fixing the cause. Grow
#   everything else freely.

# ── Pack-drift advisory (HOOKPACK-STALENESS-VISIBILITY-001) ─────────────────
# Project-local hook files SHADOW the machine runtime snapshot: a guard fix
# shipped into the runtime never reaches a repo that carries its own copy of the
# stock handler until someone ports it — and nothing says so. Compare the
# installed stock files against the pinned runtime snapshot and name the
# differing ones.
#
# Why normalized CONTENT and not the manifest hashes: `caws init` stamps the
# project copy's header with the installing CLI's pack version
# (`hook_pack_version: 67`) while the runtime snapshot keeps the template's
# literal (`hook_pack_version: 1`). EVERY installed stock file therefore differs
# from its manifest hash by that one line, so a hash comparison reports the
# whole pack as drift on a clean install and is worth nothing. The version stamp
# is the only install-time rewrite (measured exhaustively: 50/50 present stock
# files differ by that line and nothing else), and it is neutralized on BOTH
# sides with the normalizer the CLI itself uses for the same comparison in
# src/init/system-runtime.ts. The stamp appears in two header syntaxes — the
# comment form (`hook_pack_version: N`) and the JSON-description form that JSON
# templates must use because JSON has no comments (`hook_pack_version=N`) — so
# the normalizer must match both, or every JSON managed file reports as drift on
# a clean install. A genuine repo-local edit survives it and is reported.
#
# READ-ONLY + FAIL-OPEN: reads the runtime pointer, its manifest and the
# installed files, emits at most one bounded context line, and emits NOTHING
# (never blocks) when the pointer, manifest, node, or any file is unavailable.
# A customized project file is REPORTED, never overwritten, reverted or refused;
# the message routes to `caws init --plan` / `init diff` (review) and
# `caws init port` (sanctioned port). Runs BEFORE the CLI check below because it
# does not depend on the caws binary.
