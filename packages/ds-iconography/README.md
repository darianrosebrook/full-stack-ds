# @full-stack-ds/iconography

Governed icon contracts and projection emitters for Full Stack DS.

This package is the source surface for symbolic icon leaves such as
`fsds.icon.placeholder`. Component contracts and usage-style composition trees
should reference those leaves by stable name and size. Target emitters decide
how the icon becomes a framework-native import, SVG symbol, Android vector,
React Native component, Swift resource, Kotlin resource, or Figma vector.

## Authority Model

- Source contracts live in `icons/<Name>/<Name>.icon.json`.
- Size variants are first-class authored glyphs, not scaled render requests.
- Vector path data is the governed payload.
- Platform names and target projections are derived from the contract.
- Generated output under `generated/` is scratch and must not be committed.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @full-stack-ds/iconography run validate
pnpm --filter @full-stack-ds/iconography run build
```

The build emits:

- `generated/catalog.json`
- `generated/web/sprite.svg`
- `generated/web/icons/*.svg`
- `generated/react/*.tsx`
- `generated/svelte/*.svelte`
- `generated/react-native/*.tsx`
- `generated/android/drawable/*.xml`
- `generated/android/residuals.json`
- `generated/swift/*.swift`
- `generated/kotlin/*.kt`

## Emission evidence ledger

`generated/` is gitignored scratch and is never committed. Drift is proven
instead by a committed content-addressed ledger, `emission-ledger.json`, which
binds each emission's declared inputs to its produced output bytes:

- `observation_ref` = `sha256` over the emission's declared inputs (the icon
  contract + generator + schema/manifest) — "what governed this".
- `attachment_ref` = `sha256` of each emitted file's bytes — "what it emitted".
- the `(observation_ref, attachment_ref)` join = the determinism edge — "these
  inputs yield these bytes".

Because the generator is a pure function of its declared inputs, the edge set is
stable: re-emitting an unchanged artifact reproduces an edge already in the
ledger and appends nothing. Two byte-identical outputs collapse to one edge, so
churn is `O(edges-that-actually-changed)`, not `O(files-regenerated)`.

```bash
node build/ledger-icons.mjs            # build, attest, WRITE emission-ledger.json (commit this)
node build/ledger-icons.mjs --check    # build, recompute, GATE against the committed ledger
```

The gate proves drift by set membership: every edge a fresh regeneration
produces must be present in the committed ledger; a missing edge is a hard
failure naming the exact unit and file. The ledger carries substrate evidence
only — input fingerprint, output hash, emission edge — with no trust/taint
adjudication, because a generated artifact's provenance is known a priori.

`build/ledger.mjs` is the target-agnostic core (hashing, rows, dedup join,
gate). `build/ledger-components.mjs` drives that same core over a component
framework target, demonstrating the substrate is not icon-shaped.
