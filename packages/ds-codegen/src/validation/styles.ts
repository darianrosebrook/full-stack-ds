/**
 * Contract `styles.json` drift validation (after the tokens/styles
 * convergence, PLAN-TOKENS-STYLES-CONVERGENCE-001).
 *
 * Two invariants:
 *
 *   1. **Namespace rule on `resolvesTo`.** Every `resolvesTo` path in a
 *      styles.json entry must resolve. If the first dotted segment matches
 *      the contract's `cssPrefix`, the path is component-local — it must
 *      name a slot declared in `<Name>.tokens.json`. Otherwise the path
 *      points at the global token graph (`core.*` / `semantic.*`) and is
 *      checked against the composed graph the same way tokens.json
 *      `resolvesTo` is.
 *
 *   2. **Selector-aliasing collisions.** Two distinct top-level keys in
 *      styles.json that expand to the same CSS selector silently overwrite
 *      each other's declarations through the cascade. e.g. a key `hover`
 *      (expands to `.x:hover`) AND a key `:hover` (also `.x:hover`) is an
 *      authoring bug — the author thought they were targeting different
 *      things. We surface it as DRIFT.
 *
 * Doctrinal stance, matching the sibling tokens.ts validator: never
 * modifies anything. Reads the contract and the composed-token-graph
 * cache, returns one ValidationIssue per problem.

 * RAIL-WEB-STYLE-CARRIER-REACHABILITY-01 — does authored CSS demand a carrier

 * `styles.json` accepts raw-selector keys that `expandStylesKey` passes through
 * verbatim, and nothing has ever checked them against what the emitters place
 * on an element. `Details.styles.json` authors `.details--icon-none
 * .details__icon`, while `classRecipe` emits `details--${icon}` for that
 * disjoint axis — so the rule compiles into all five web packages and matches
 * nothing. Same shape one level down: a `__part` block for a part the dom tree
 * never carries.
 *
 * The question this answers, exactly: **does every component-owned carrier an
 * authored selector requires appear in the set the IR can produce?** It is one
 * direction only. An emitted variant class with no matching CSS rule is the
 * INVERSE problem (a declared visual distinction nobody painted) and is not a
 * finding here — that census lives in the variant-style rail.
 *
 * Named non-claims. A reachable carrier does NOT mean the rule wins the
 * cascade, changes computed style, supplies content the part needs, or
 * realizes the intended visual distinction: repairing Details' modifier proves
 * the selector can attach to an element, not that the disclosure indicator is
 * functionally complete (its `__icon` span is empty). Pseudo-class host
 * satisfiability (`:disabled` on a `<span>`), `aria-*` truth, and suppression
 * guards stay with the element-awareness and pseudo-state rails; this
 * validator does not evaluate them.
 *
 * A finding is never authority to delete the contract side. Resolution may be
 * selector repair, realization repair, or independently justified contract
 * retirement — adjudicated per case, per
 * FIX-DEAD-SLOT-UNRENDERED-PART-AUTHORITY-01.
