/**
 * Angular admission rail (post CODEGEN-RAIL-ANGULAR-NGTSC-01).
 *
 * Two commands, each attributed to a distinct check:
 *
 * 1. `typecheck` (raw tsc) — proves the generated `.component.ts`
 *    files type-check as plain TypeScript modules. Covers IR-level
 *    type errors, @Input typing, signal usage, etc.
 *
 * 2. `templateTypecheck` (ngc with strictTemplates) — proves the
 *    generated @Component template strings parse and type-check
 *    against the Angular compiler's view of HTMLElement types and
 *    standalone-component imports. Catches NG8002 (binding to
 *    read-only IDL like <label>.form), NG8113 (unused standalone
 *    imports), NG6004 (missing standalone imports), etc.
 *
 * Both run unconditionally; a failure in one does NOT short-circuit
 * the other, so a single rail invocation surfaces the full
 * admission picture.
 *
 * Manifest×command scope authority
 * (CODEGEN-RAIL-ARTIFACT-MANIFEST-ADMISSION-01):
 *   - `typecheck` (tsc) sees `src/**` of `packages/ds-angular/`,
 *     including tests. `.ts` only — Angular emits no `.tsx`.
 *   - `templateTypecheck` (ngc) uses `tsconfig.ngc.json` which
 *     excludes `src/**\/__tests__/**` and `*.spec.ts`/`*.test.ts`.
 *     The join treats tests as `not_selected` for this command
 *     (they ARE covered by the raw `typecheck` command).
