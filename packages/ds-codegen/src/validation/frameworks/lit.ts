/**
 * Lit admission rail (post CODEGEN-RAIL-LIT-TEMPLATE-ADMISSION-01).
 *
 * Two commands, each attributed to a distinct check:
 *
 * 1. `typecheck` (raw tsc) — proves the generated `.ts` files
 *    type-check as plain TypeScript modules.
 *
 * 2. `templateTypecheck` (lit-analyzer) — proves the generated
 *    lit-html `html\`...\`` template literals parse against
 *    lit-analyzer's HTML data model, with all enabled rules
 *    except the one declared rule narrowing.
 *
 * Declared rule narrowing: `no-incompatible-type-binding` is
 * disabled. Rationale: lit-analyzer's HTML data model requires
 * literal-union compatibility for several DOM attributes where
 * the design-system contracts intentionally expose broader
 * `string` APIs (e.g. `<input type=${this.type}>` where the
 * contract keeps `type?: string` to preserve HTML/future/custom
 * value compatibility, and channel-bound `aria-expanded` where
 * the IR-derived channel value type is broader than the strict
 * ARIA literal-union slot). This is a declared analyzer-policy
 * boundary, NOT defect masking — the runtime is type-correct
 * under the package TypeScript pass, and lit-analyzer continues
 * to exercise every other rule (template syntax, decorator
 * metadata, missing imports, nullable/undefined leakage, invalid
 * bindings not caused by this contract-policy mismatch, ...).
