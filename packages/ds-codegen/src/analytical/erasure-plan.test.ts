/**
 * THE OPERATION'S OWN LAW.
 *
 * Everything above this point checks WHERE an erasure writes and what it costs.
 * None of it checks what the erasure FORGETS, and those are different claims.
 * `checkIsolation` cannot supply the missing one either: legality and locality
 * are necessary side conditions on an erasure, not a definition of it. An
 * operation can stay inside its own slot, leave a schema-legal image, and still
 * be the wrong function.
 *
 * The specimen that forced this block: `forget-reference-order` returning
 * `[...v].sort().map((_x, _i, arr) => arr[0])`. It is idempotent, it writes only
 * inside the plan's slot, and every image it produces is schema-legal — so
 * composition, footprint and isolation all pass it — yet it destroys membership
 * while claiming to forget only order. It survived all 222 tests in this file,
 * `quotient-image.test.ts` and `necessity.test.ts` together. Only the recorded
 * freeze noticed, and a moved digest proves a byte changed, not that a law broke.
 *
 * Lawful forgetting is EXACT IDENTIFICATION, which is two obligations pulling
 * against each other:
 *
 *   IDENTIFIES  stimuli differing only in the fact the coordinate names must
 *               produce equal images — otherwise the operation does not forget.
 *   SEPARATES   stimuli differing in any fact the coordinate does NOT name must
 *               produce different images — otherwise it forgets something else.
 *
 * Only the pair binds. Either alone is satisfied by a degenerate function:
 * identity satisfies SEPARATES, and a constant satisfies IDENTIFIES.
