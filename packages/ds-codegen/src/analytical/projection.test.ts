/**
 * The projection BINDING and REPRESENTATION boundary
 * (REL-PROJECTION-BINDING-01, REL-PROJECTION-REPRESENTATION-01).
 *
 * What the binding slice established, and what it did NOT: both of its consumers
 * called `evaluateOperation`, so nothing representation-dependent lay between
 * them. Their agreement showed that the binding and channel guards admit one
 * shared evaluation — not that a value survived a text or metric encoding.
 *
 * This file tests the boundary that closes that: one admitted sum, two PRODUCED
 * representations, and recovery observed from each representation by a decoder
 * that receives neither the rows nor the evaluator.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS ARE ARITHMETIC. Summing over `product` at each `date` gives 30 and
 * 105; at a declared scale of two extent units per value those are extents 60
 * and 210. Summing over `date` gives 110 and 25, the direction the
 * semi-additivity declaration forbids.
