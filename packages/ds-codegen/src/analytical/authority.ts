/**
 * The identities recorded evidence is bound to, and what each one invalidates.
 *
 * A digest here is ATTRIBUTION, never correctness. The tests prove behaviour;
 * an identity proves that a recorded verdict still refers to the behaviour it
 * was recorded against. When one moves, the evidence bound to it is rejected
 * and re-earned rather than silently re-read.
 *
 * THE IDENTITIES ARE A PARTITION, and that is the whole design. A single
 * "everything the harness touches" digest answers "something moved" — which is
 * the least useful thing it could say, because every cause looks alike and
 * re-recording becomes a ritual. Here each module is owned by exactly one
 * identity, so a moved digest names its cause: the coordinates changed, or what
 * an erasure does changed, or what admits a witness changed, or a RULE changed.
 * `RULE_SOURCES` in `necessity.ts` is the fourth member of that partition and is
 * deliberately not restated here; a changed rule digest and a changed erasure
 * digest are different causes and must not collapse into one another.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS THE OWNERSHIP HONEST is not this file — a hand-maintained list can
 * always under-claim, which is exactly how `alphaRename` came to sit inside the
 * judgment surface unnoticed. It is `authority.test.ts`, which walks the local
 * import graph from each identity's entry points and requires every module it
 * reaches to be owned by some identity or excluded with a reason. Extracting a
 * helper into a new file is reached through its import and reported.
 *
 * It imports nothing local, on purpose: a module in an identity's closure
 * cannot also be the module that defines the closure.
