# Full Stack DS for Unity UI Toolkit

A local UPM package with contract-generated Switch, Accordion, Popover and Tabs controls. Unity 6 is the API baseline. Generated controls carry `[UxmlElement]` and are usable from C#, UXML and UI Builder; the same runtime assembly serves Editor windows and `UIDocument` panels.

## Import

In Unity's Package Manager, choose **Install package from disk** and select this directory's `package.json`. Keep the package directory at a stable path. This is a local package, not a published Unity registry dependency.

Open **Window → Full Stack DS → Interactive Controls** for the C# showcase. Import **Interactive controls** from the package's Samples section to get `Controls.uxml` and `RuntimeExample.cs`. Open the UXML in UI Builder. For runtime use, assign it to a `UIDocument` with a `PanelSettings` asset and add `RuntimeExample` to that GameObject.

```xml
<ui:UXML xmlns:ui="UnityEngine.UIElements" xmlns:ds="FullStackDS">
    <ds:Switch label="Enable sound" checked="true" />
    <ds:Accordion collapsible="true">
        <ds:AccordionItem value="graphics" label="Graphics">
            <ui:Label text="Rendering preferences" />
        </ds:AccordionItem>
    </ds:Accordion>
    <ds:Tabs>
        <ds:TabsItem value="first" label="First"><ui:Label text="First panel" /></ds:TabsItem>
        <ds:TabsItem value="second" label="Second"><ui:Label text="Second panel" /></ds:TabsItem>
    </ds:Tabs>
    <ds:Popover label="Help"><ui:Label text="Helpful content" /></ds:Popover>
</ui:UXML>
```

## State and composition

Switch uses `Checked`, `value`, `SetValueWithoutNotify` and Unity's `RegisterValueChangedCallback`. Popover uses `Open` and the same boolean-channel APIs. `Label` supplies trigger text. Both expose the actual UI Toolkit `Trigger`; Popover routes `Add(child)` into its `Content` container.

Accordion and Tabs expose `Value`, `Values`, `ValueChanged`, and `SetValuesWithoutNotify`. Construct an `AccordionItem` or `TabsItem`, set its non-empty unique `Value` and `Label`, add arbitrary content with `item.Add(child)`, then call `group.AddItem(item)`. UXML children register on panel attachment. Use `RemoveItem` before changing keys or moving an item to another group. For imperative `Add`/`Remove` outside these helpers, call `SynchronizeChildren` to update registration.

Accordion defaults to single selection with `Collapsible = false`; use `Type = "multiple"` and `Values` for multiple sections. Tabs supports horizontal/vertical orientation, automatic/manual activation, looping, disabled items, Home/End, arrow navigation and `UnmountInactive`. Native UI Toolkit buttons own pointer and submit activation. Accordion's vertical arrows move focus without selecting.

Values assigned before attachment provide initial state. For owner-controlled state, set `Controlled = true`, handle `ValueRequested`, and commit an accepted value through `Checked`, `Open`, `Value` or `Values`. A request alone does not change presentation. This is a C# adaptation of the contract's controlled/default channel trio; C# event signatures use arrays for both Accordion selection modes.

Popover portals content to its current panel root. It uses the anchor/content union for outside-pointer and blur dismissal, returns focus to the trigger on Escape, and flips/shifts at panel edges. Dismissal flags remain configurable. Removing a Popover unregisters its panel callbacks and removes the floating content.

## Runtime styling

Controls attach the package stylesheet automatically in both Editor and Player panels. Popover content attaches it independently when moved to the panel root. Call `FullStackDS.Theme.Attach(container)` to apply the same text and button styling to a surrounding consumer container. The imported sample also includes the stylesheet for its layout and background.

The stylesheet lives in `Runtime/Resources/FullStackDS/Controls.uss`: explicit typography, selected/disabled/focus states, switch spacing and wrapped, scrollable floating content. These are Unity pilot defaults, not a generated projection of the complete token graph. Consumer overrides should target the `fsds-*` classes; floating content lives outside the originating container, so apply overrides to `popover.Content` as well.

`PanelSettings` still owns screen scaling. The visual witnesses use **Constant Pixel Size**, scale 1, at 640×800 and 320×600. A consumer using **Scale With Screen Size** and a 960×640 reference can shrink the entire interface in a small Game view. Choose the scale mode and reference resolution for your game; the package does not overwrite them. Reimport the sample from Package Manager to update a previously copied sample.

## Regenerate and verify

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm run generate:unity
pnpm exec vitest run packages/ds-codegen/src/frameworks/unity/factory.test.ts
pnpm run test:unity
```

`test:unity` copies the package and sample into `tmp/unity-pilot/project`, then runs real Unity EditMode tests. It needs an activated Editor license and a graphics device for the live Editor panels. Set `UNITY_EDITOR` to the Editor executable when using a different installation. Logs and NUnit XML stay in `tmp/unity-pilot`. Styling tests enter Play mode, render a real Player panel into a texture, and save PNG witnesses under `tmp/unity-pilot/screenshots`; Editor typography, spacing and focus are checked through resolved styles and geometry.

`node scripts/unity-tests.mjs --compile-only` is a separate diagnostic using the installed macOS Unity SDK, real Unity assemblies and Unity's UXML source generator. It checks runtime, Editor showcase and sample compilation; it does **not** run Unity, import UXML or execute tests.

## Pilot boundary

The allowlist is in the repository's `fsds.targets.json`. The Unity backend is selected by `--target=all` but is outside the TypeScript admission rail. Its EditMode lane is local and explicit, not an existing CI gate.

This slice implements the interactions above. It does not claim full framework parity, screen-reader integration, controller/gamepad navigation, player-build admission, or full visual parity. Default-size switch geometry uses typed token fallback facts; the remaining visual skin is a small Unity-specific base theme. Dynamic brands, other switch sizes, token-color projection, motion, exact compound anatomy, icon-catalog fidelity, browser form props and DOM IDs are not ported. The disclosure marker uses a text affordance rather than the iconography catalog. Tabs keeps an inactive panel's object state even when detached.
