        This repository is not, primarily, a design system. It is a falsifiable
        claim about compositional systems. The {componentCount} components, one
        primitive, and five frameworks exist to test the claim — not as
        product surface, but as the falsification surface that would make any
        wrongness in the contract visible. The same discipline is under attack
        in other domains — design tokens, iconography, analytical relations,
        the documentation site itself, and the evidence machinery — where
        &ldquo;component&rdquo; stops being a useful concept. The full program

          Compositional systems — systems where higher-order artifacts are
          assembled from lower-order ones under shared constraints —
          converge on a single architectural shape. Systems that conform to

          and survive transfer to new substrates. Systems that resist it

          Five frameworks is not a feature. It is the test. React hooks, Vue
          composables, Svelte runes, Angular signals, and Lit reactive
          controllers are structurally opposed paradigms — immutable virtual
          DOM with hooks versus mutable shadow DOM with controllers, function
          components versus classes, synthetic events versus native events.
          If the same contract can drive all five idiomatically without
          leaking implementation detail into any of them, the contract is at
          the right level of abstraction. If it cannot, the wrongness shows up
          as friction in exactly one output.

          Components are the easiest demonstration because the failure is
          visually obvious. The same shape — one authority, a normalized
          substrate, governed composition, target-specific projections, and
          observable drift — is under attack where &ldquo;component&rdquo;
          stops being a useful concept:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Design tokens.</strong> A DTCG graph resolves primitive
            values into semantic aliases and theme/brand/density layers. The
            finding that matters is the split between vocabulary and
            obligation: an unused palette entry is latent vocabulary and stays
            valid, while an unconsumed component override slot is a broken
            interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Iconography.</strong> One symbolic contract projects to
            SVG, React, Svelte, React Native, Android vectors, Swift, and
            Kotlin — and its emission ledger is deliberately not icon-shaped:
            the same content-addressed provenance core runs over component
            generation unchanged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytical relations.</strong> A chart type is a theorem,
            not a primitive: a typed relational structure admits or refuses
            projections, and the necessity census keeps every coordinate
            honest by requiring a witness that deleting it collapses two
            distinguishable states.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Documentation and evidence.</strong> This showcase derives
            its content from the contracts instead of restating them, consumes
            the generated system it documents, and attests its own artifacts
            through the admission rail and ratcheted ledgers — explanation and
            proof are projections, not second authorities.

          Target count is pressure on the claim, not its scorecard: a

        </Stack>
        <p>
          The operative concern is governance, not composition.
          &ldquo;Compositional&rdquo; describes the result; governance
          describes the work. A system has the normal form when the rules
          about what can be composed with what, by whom, and under what
          guarantees are encoded structurally — in contracts, IRs, fail-loud
          boundaries, mutable/immutable site discipline, and consumer-facing
          descriptors — rather than encoded socially in convention, review
          culture, or institutional memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point of encoding governance structurally is not control for its
          own sake. It is to <strong>raise the floor so the quality bar is
          easier to hit</strong>. Without the normal form, doing the right
          thing requires heroic effort by every contributor on every change.
          With it, the right thing is the path of least resistance, and the
          wrong thing is loud enough to be visible before it ships.

        <p>The seven properties are the outcome of a recurring methodological move:</p>
        <ol className="arch-move">
          <li>
            <strong>Refuse the surface request.</strong> &ldquo;Add a new

            new primitive.&rdquo; Take the request seriously enough to ask
            what it is actually asking for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Diagnose the actual ask.</strong> What is under-represented
            in the current contract? The diagnostic question is &ldquo;what
            is the contract missing that makes the obvious answer
            wrong?&rdquo;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Name the domain-scoped trap.</strong> Most surface
            requests are domain-specific solutions to under-represented
            general problems.

          <li>

            Push the new capability down into a primitive or contract field
            that all consumers can use. Simultaneously raise the governance
            to cover the new composition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Validate that governance survives the composition.</strong>{" "}
            The test is not &ldquo;does the new thing work.&rdquo; It is

        <p>
          This is what produces the constraint of one primitive, many
          components. The constraint was not chosen aesthetically. It is the
          result of refusing the surface request &ldquo;add a new
          primitive&rdquo; often enough that the contract was forced to grow
          the fields that make the new primitive unnecessary.
