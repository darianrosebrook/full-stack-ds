/**
 * Chrome coverage ratchet (SHOWCASE-CHROME-T1-01).
 *
 * The showcase must statically consume the DS families it has adopted as real
 * app chrome. This test derives the family set from the generated package
 * (readdir — self-maintaining as the corpus grows) and asserts every family in
 * the adopted tier appears as a NAMED static import in src/'s chrome files.
 *
 * What does NOT count as chrome adoption:
 *   - `import * as DS` namespace rendering (DisplayCaseView, usage-registry,
 *     render-usage) — those are exhibit surfaces that render components as
 *     catalog samples, not the app building itself with them.
 *   - test files.
 *
 * PENDING (tier 2 — phase 3 surfaces: Settings/Activity/About/tour):
 *   Avatar, Calendar, CodeBlock, Command, Dialog, Field, Image, Markdown, OTP,
 *   Postcard, ProfileFlag, Sheet, Shuttle, TextField, ToggleSwitch, Walkthrough.
 * Field waits for phase 3's Settings form, where it pairs with Input (the
 * control that consumes its association context); Select does not consume it.
 * Text is blocked by an emitter gap: the contract declares a `children` slot
 * but the emitted React TextProps omits it, so JSX children are type-illegal.
 * Track in residual backlog; adopt once the emitter declares it.

 * emitter forwards what the contract declares (residual backlog).
 *   Text:    TextProps omits `children` — JSX content is type-illegal.
 *   Command: root renders internal scaffold only; consumer children are
 *            never forwarded, so palette entries cannot compose.
 *   Shuttle: root renders only the current selection; candidate items have
 *            no path in, so a transfer is impossible.
